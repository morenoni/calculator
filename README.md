# Mini-Project 2: Fun with Fractions.

Author: Nicole Moreno Gonzalez

A project for CSC-207 2024Fa.

This is a project that acts like a fraction and integer calculator, with two different types of input&output formats: Interactive and Quick Calculator.

For InteractiveCalculator, after starting the program input style is line by line. After each line, theres an output, and you can exit the program anytime using QUIT. QuickCalculator allows writing multiple operation arguments as command-line inputs. After running the program, the outputs are calculated at the same time and then returned.
